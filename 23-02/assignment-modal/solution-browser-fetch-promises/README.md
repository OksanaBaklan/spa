# Promise me a modal

**Instructions**
- Create a promise that, once resolved, displays a modal to the user after the user spends 60 seconds on the page
- Investigate `src/index.html` and `src/styles/main.scss`, but you don't actually have to edit them
- Add your JavaScript to `src/scripts/index.js`
- Hint: Read all output from the terminal :)
- Do not use Live server, instead use `npm start` to run the project.

- **BONUS** The user should be able to close the modal somehow :)
