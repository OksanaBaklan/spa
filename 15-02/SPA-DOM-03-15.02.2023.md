- Manipulating elements

## Mini recap, DOM traversal and manipulation

- Who can tell me about the window object? 
- Who can tell me about the document object?

> The Window represents a window containing a DOM document
> The document property of window is DOM document loaded in that window

- Today we will mostly practice more DOM techniques
- JavaScript can do anything in the browser
- But it takes time to get used to it and to practice the techniques

- When I say DOM traversal, what do you think?
    - Targeting different elements on the DOM tree
    - Moving from element to element
        - Element to parent
        - Element to child element(s)
        - Element to sibling
        - etc
